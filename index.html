                <h2>About Peter Stanley</h2>
                <p id="about_peter">As a Senior Associate at PwC Strategy&, I help clients bridge the gap between business strategy and technology implementation. I've meaningfully impacted clients facing diverse challenges, ranging from highly complex business transformations to technology resilience strategies, and I excel in quantitative modeling and executive storytelling. I also get excited about emerging technology and have driven forward firm initiatives on GenAI, including internal panels and firm GTM material.

                Prior to consulting, I managed the construction of $200M+ cryogenic gas plants and NGL fractionators at ONEOK, where I supported midstream energy facility startups and introduced innovative solutions to accelerate project schedules. My work at ONEOK required a substantial amount of time spent in the field across rural North Dakota, Oklahoma, and Texas. 
                    
                In and out of work, I'm passionate about working alongside driven and empathetic people, emerging technology, coffee, and all things Marvel.</p>
